    <h2>Sentencing Analysis</h2>
    <p><strong>Sanction Imposed:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>17 years and 9 months’ imprisonment</li>
      <li>Non-parole period of 14 years</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Sentencing Purposes Considered:</strong></p>

      <li>Mental Condition: Diagnosed with autism and intellectual disability – raised questions about his intent and understanding.</li>

      <li>Age: Middle-aged at the time of the offence – not considered elderly.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Justice Principles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fairness:</strong> The court made efforts to ensure a fair trial, such as controlling media influence and explaining legal procedures clearly. But, there were concerns about Sokaluk’s ability to understand the courts proceedings due to his mental condition.</li>
      <li><strong>Equality:</strong> Sokaluk was treated in accordance to legal standards, but with his disabilities he may have been disadvantaged during the trial, raising ethical and legal concerns about procedural equality.</li>
      <li><strong>Access:</strong> He was provided with adequate legal representation and psychological assessment, although some people argue that more accommodations should have been made to help him participate fully in the process.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Viewpoint of a Relevant Person:</strong></p>
    <p>From the perspective of a young person with a disability: The case raises a large number of questions about how individuals with intellectual disability are treated in the justice system. Some people may feel that people like Sokaluk are vulnerable and not fully capable of defending themselves in a standard court process.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>R v Brendan Sokaluk (2012) highlights both strengths and weaknesses in Victoria’s criminal justice system. On one hand, it shows that the system can hold individuals accountable for catastrophic harm. On the other, it exposes significant challenges in dealing with offenders who have cognitive disabilities. The case suggests a need for a better way of doing things to ensure these individuals not only understand the legal process and receive fair treatment but learn it themselves so they don't reoffend. Much Greater awareness and training for legal professionals, as well as improved support systems for vulnerable defendants, will provide better justice in future cases for many not only in victoria but around Australia.</p>

    <h2>Nature of the Offence</h2>
    <p>In the case of Melbourne’s ‘Tinder Swindler’, Emily Woods, a Melbourne woman in which a 33-year-old Christopher Collins had swindled thousands of dollars off her. She met Collins originally on tinder, where he went by the name ‘CJ’. They chatted briefly about their interest before he declared he was a ‘professional gambler’. This is where the scamming would begin. Collins persuaded her to put money on a 100% bet and convinced her to open some new online betting accounts. Shortly after they went to a Richmond pub in which whilst Woods was on the dancefloor Collins had transferred $96,000 from her bank accounts and moved $72,000 into online betting accounts.</p>

    <h2>Legal Institutions Involved</h2>

      <li><strong>Victoria Police:</strong> VICPOL conducted the original investigation and arrested Collins after victims testified with reports of identity theft and fraud.</li>

    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Sentencing Analysis</h2>
    <p><strong>Sanction imposed:</strong> 22 months imprisonment</p>
    <p><strong>Sentencing purposes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Punishment:</strong> To hold Collins accountable for his actions that were deliberately exploiting individual.</li>
      <li><strong>Deterrence:</strong> To warn other about potential online dating scams.</li>
      <li><strong>Rehabilitation:</strong> Less prevalent however it may be considered if Collins displayed remorse or potential reform.</li>
      <li><strong>Protection:</strong> To prevent further harm for vulnerable individuals.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Factors Considered</h2>
    <p>Collins prior history was taken into account as he had a record of dishonesty through past offences. The defence attempted to argue for a reduced sentence however the prosecution argued the lack of genuine remorse shown by Collins. His age showed he was an adult showing he has full awareness that what he was doing was wrong. There was also no evidence of public information that suggested Collins was suffering a mental illness.</p>

    <h2>Justice Principles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fairness</strong> – The trail was conducted impartially with no bias towards any parties.</li>
      <li><strong>Equality</strong> – Collins was treated equally under the Victorian law.</li>
      <li><strong>Access</strong> – All parties involved in the case had legal avenues to access information.</li>
    </ul>

  <section>
    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>The Melbourne Tinder swindler case highlights how the community may feel a sense of insecurity towards online apps, in particular dating apps, as the Melbourne Tinder Swindler case emphasises the danger in exploitative behaviour from people who you don’t truly know and its consequences. Weaknesses that may arise include that the punishment of 22 months imprisonment may not have been enough for Collins. This can be argued due to the fact that the victims of Collins actions have experienced severe trauma and extensive amounts of stress accompanied by Collins lack of genuine remorse shown.</p>

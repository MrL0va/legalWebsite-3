      <h2>About This Episode</h2>
      <p>In this episode of <strong>Case by Case</strong>, we break down four real Victorian criminal cases — R v Brendan Sokaluk (2012), HPP v Hyslop, DPP v Collins, and The Abbotsford Matricide — to uncover how the justice system applies sentencing, rehabilitation, and legal principles in different circumstances.</p>
  
      <p>Each host takes on a different case, exploring the roles of police, courts, and juries, while analyzing the sanctions imposed and the reasons behind them. We also look at whether key principles like fairness, equality, and access were upheld — especially for vulnerable groups such as young people, neurodivergent individuals, and First Nations victims.</p>    
      
      <p>From youth justice to mental impairment, this episode asks: is justice consistent, or does it shift case by case?</p>
    
      <p>The main goal of this episode is to compare these three cases to The Abbotsford Matricide.</p>

Her 15-year-old son along with his 14-year-old friend eventually were charged with her murder. This offence would be constituted as a indictable offence due to the fact of it being a matricide (killings ones mother)</p>

      <li>15-year-old boy (unnamed, the victim’s son)</li>

      <li>Both reportedly autistic and fed into each other's delusional ideas</li>
      <li>41-year-old mother (stabbed multiple times, died from complications)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Trial summary and sentencing outcome</h3>

      <li><strong>Purposes:</strong> Punishment, rehabilitation, and protection</li>
      <li><strong>Factors considered:</strong> Prior history, age, mental health, premeditation</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Justice Principles</h3>

      <li><strong>Equality:</strong> Both were treated within the bounds of youth and mental health law</li>
      <li><strong>Access:</strong> Both accessed legal and psychiatric services, though challenges with comprehension may have remained</li>
    </ul>
